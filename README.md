# Speech-To-Life plugin Example project

This is the example project for the speech-To-Life plugin which will be released on the Unreal Marketplace sometime soon.

See the [documentation wiki](https://github.com/SolarStormInteractive/SpeechToLife_Docs/wiki) for full information and documentation about the plugin itself.

To target Oculus Quest VR, see [this wiki pages](https://github.com/SolarStormInteractive/SpeechToLife_Docs/wiki/Android-Details) section on Oculus Quest configuration. By default, this example project targets android default (untouched configuration) because targeting Oculus Quest breaks supporting basic android devices.
